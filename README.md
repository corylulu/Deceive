Pretend like you aren't actually feeding your ass off in League of Legends. **Deceive** allows you to mask your online status if you use the new League client.
Once started, Deceive will be a little icon in your notification tray that allows you to manage whether or not you appear as offline or mobile to your friends.  

Click the [Releases](https://github.com/molenzwiebel/Deceive/releases) tab at the top to download the latest version. Click the image below for a demo of Deceive.
